# GrowCast Timelapse

A lightweight GrowCast extension script that captures snapshots from an RTSP camera feed and continuously builds a `latest_timelapse.mp4` file.

## 1. Project Overview

`GrowCast-Timelapse/main.py`:
- Connects to an RTSP stream using `ffmpeg`
- Captures `.webp` snapshots on a schedule
- Generates/updates a timelapse video from all snapshots

Key features:
- Supports trigger-by-time (`TIME_1`, `TIME_2`, `TIME_3`)
- Supports interval-based capture (`INTERVAL` in minutes)
- Rebuilds timelapse after every successful snapshot

## 2. Demo / Screenshots

No screenshots here right now, but if you want to check how it looks, see [my instance](https://grow.0xmarcel.com).

## 3. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install:
- Python 3.10+
- `ffmpeg` available in your `PATH`
- `pip`

Check versions:

```bash
python3 --version
ffmpeg -version
pip3 --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Put the `GrowCast-Timelapse` folder into your GrowCast extension folder.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables Setup

1. Copy the example file:

```bash
cp GrowCast-Timelapse/.env.example GrowCast-Timelapse/.env
```

2. Edit `GrowCast-Timelapse/.env`:

```env
RTSP_STREAM=rtsp://username:password@camera-ip:554/stream
TIME_1=08:00
TIME_2=12:00
TIME_3=18:00
INTERVAL=
SNAPSHOT_DIR_OUT=./snapshots
TIMELAPSE_DIR_OUT=./timelapse
TIMELAPSE_LENGTH_SECONDS=10
```

Notes:
- You must set `RTSP_STREAM`.
- Configure either `TIME_1/2/3` and/or `INTERVAL`.
- Time format must be `HH:MM` (24-hour).

## 4. Running the Application

### Development mode

From the repository root:

```bash
cd GrowCast-Timelapse
python3 main.py
```

The process stays running and executes scheduled jobs.

### Production-like run

Same command, but run it with a process manager so it survives terminal close:
- `systemd` (Linux)
- `launchd` (macOS)
- Docker or your GrowCast host process manager

├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
└── README.md
```

## 6. Configuration

Key runtime config is in `GrowCast-Timelapse/.env`:
- `RTSP_STREAM`: camera stream URL
- `TIME_1`, `TIME_2`, `TIME_3`: fixed daily capture times
- `INTERVAL`: capture every N minutes
- `SNAPSHOT_DIR_OUT`: snapshot output folder
- `TIMELAPSE_DIR_OUT`: timelapse output folder
- `TIMELAPSE_LENGTH_SECONDS`: target duration used to calculate FPS

## 7. Usage Guide

1. Start the script.
2. Confirm startup logs show configuration accepted.
3. Wait for scheduled trigger(s).
4. Check outputs:
- snapshots in `snapshots/`
- video in `timelapse/latest_timelapse.mp4`

End-user expectation: each successful capture updates the timelapse.

## 8. API or Backend

No HTTP API/backend service is included.

This is a local scheduled worker script that calls `ffmpeg` via subprocess.

## 9. Deployment

### GrowCast extension deployment

1. Copy `GrowCast-Timelapse/` into your GrowCast extensions directory.
2. Install dependencies on the host machine.
3. Configure `.env`.
4. Start `main.py` from your extension runtime/host.

### Important Autostart Note

This extension does **not** autostart by default.
You must configure startup manually (for example with your GrowCast host process manager, `systemd`, `launchd`, cron + `@reboot`, or another supervisor).

## 10. Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- `RTSP_STREAM is required`
  - Set `RTSP_STREAM` in `.env`.
- `You must define either TIME_1, TIME_2, TIME_3 or INTERVAL`
  - Add at least one schedule mode.
- `Invalid time format`
  - Use `HH:MM` (e.g. `07:30`).
- `ffmpeg: command not found`
  - Install `ffmpeg` and ensure it is in `PATH`.
- No files being generated
  - Verify camera URL, network reachability, and credentials.

## 11. Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

Suggested workflow:
1. Create a branch.
2. Make focused changes.
3. Test with a real or test RTSP stream.
4. Open a PR with logs/screenshots when relevant.
